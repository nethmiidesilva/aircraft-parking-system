# ✈️ Aircraft Parking System

A **C++-based Aircraft Parking System** developed as a console application. This project optimizes aircraft parking logistics at airports using **doubly linked lists**, enabling efficient scheduling, tracking, and manipulation of aircraft data.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **📋 Dynamic Data Management**: Utilizes a **doubly linked list** for efficient aircraft entry organization, ensuring fast access and seamless updates.
- **ℹ️ Comprehensive Information Display**: Tracks airline names, registration numbers, entry/departure times, and dates.
- **👩‍💻 Precision Input Validation**: Ensures accurate time and date formatting, minimizing errors and maintaining data consistency.
- **⏳ Real-time Parking Status**: Provides live updates on parking availability for optimized resource allocation.
- **📒 Flexible Modification & Deletion**: Allows seamless updates to accommodate schedule changes.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **C++**
- **Data Structures**: Doubly Linked List
